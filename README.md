# Fluid Simulator 

An implementaion of the Fast Fluid Dynamics algorithm for fluid simulation based on [this](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/books/HTML/gpugems/gpugems_ch38.html) gpu gems chapter and [this](https://github.com/sanjayyepuri/fluids) webassembly example, built with pure JavaScript and WebGL 1.0 (and webpack I guess).
